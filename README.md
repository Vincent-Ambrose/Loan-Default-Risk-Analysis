Description of the project:

This project aim to prepare a report for the loan division of a bank. The need is to find out if a client's
marital status, age, number of children, education etc have an impact on a loan default. 
The bank already has some data on the creditworthiness of customers (see the .csv file in the Repo). 
This was considered for creating a credit score for actual and future potential customers. 

The project is done in VS code with Jupyter Notebook extension.

In this repository you can find the .csv file to perform this analysis
