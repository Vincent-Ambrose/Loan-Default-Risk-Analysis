# Loan-Default-Risk-Analysis
A quick analysis of a debtor's creditworthiness


Description of the project
Our project involves preparing a report for the loan division of a bank. We will need to find out if a client's
marital status and number of children have an impact on a loan default. 
The bank already has some data on the creditworthiness of customers.
Our report will be considered fot creating a credit score for a customer potential. 
A credit score is used to assess the ability of a potential borrower to repay his loan.
